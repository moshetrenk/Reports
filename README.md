# Reports
Not OO- basically everything is done in one main(), for this aplication it makes it easier to maintain the code - forgive how ugly it is, it just automates a few hours of my job

NJ Division of taxation reports from Easybiz software PDF files. Copy and paste the pdf into a .txt and the work is largely done for schedule G sales. The report should come from Reports>Sales>Inventory Sales Report. I suggest using the category report rather than item or subcategory. To my knowledge, there won't be any issue  if you choose to use a different report. Needs to be updated for different brands. Any company for which most items will fall under the schedule G should just add the first word of non-cigarette items in the big if statement
